# Tekken 7 Movelists -- DEPRECATED (see below)

Good learning resources seem to be \*scattered around the web\*, so this project aims to build a nice reference to either newbies or veterans who wish to learn and improve their skill and game knowledge.

This is not possible without the help of very generous people within our Tekken community, for their feedback and contributions.

### New version in the works

This website was a fun experience from a 'just out of college' fun project, but given the potencial for the website with its impact on learning the game, I've decided to remake this in a proper fashion, easier to maintain, up-to-date information and also to actually be collaborative.

Stay tuned! This WILL HAPPEN! :D
